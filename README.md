# DotNetDevOps Extensions for EAV Modelling

This library adds supprot for dynamic data modelling and a EAV framework on top of EF Core


# DotNetDevOps.Extensions.EAVFramework.SourceGenerator

The generator works by creating the same in memory dll that the runtime framework does. From this in memory dll it generates the sourcecode needed. 

Currently Methods cant be genrerated, so its only DTO properties.
